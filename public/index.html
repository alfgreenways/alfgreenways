<h1>Alf Greenways' Website about Adult ADHD</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Alf Greenways.  I've been a lifelong ADHDer and only recently realized it in my 30s.  I have finally figured out why life has been so hard and have made it one of my primary focuses to understand and address this problem in myself.  I wanted to write what has most helped me so that perhaps it may help you.</p>

<p>P.S. This website is intentionally left without styles currently and is just a single html file because I know that otherwise I'd spend 300 hours setting up a blogging engine with the perfect everything and never publish.</p>
